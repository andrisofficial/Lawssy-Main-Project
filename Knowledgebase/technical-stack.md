- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling enabled via AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Docker container orchestration
- **Performance**: Optimized with Redis caching, PostgreSQL indexing, and CDN for static assets

## Development Workflow

- **Branching Strategy**: GitFlow
  - feature/* branches for new features
  - bugfix/* branches for bug fixes
  - develop branch for integration
  - main branch for production releases
- **Code Quality**:
  - ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style
  - Husky pre-commit hooks to enforce quality standards
  - Required code reviews via GitHub pull requests
- **Testing**:
  - Jest (v29.5.0): Unit testing with 80% coverage minimum requirement
  - Cypress (v12.0.0): End-to-end testing for critical legal workflows
  - Regular security scanning via Snyk

## Additional Tools & Services
- **Email**: SendGrid (notifications, invoices) or AWS SES (transactional emails)
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch tracks CPU usage, latency, and errors; Mixpanel monitors user engagement
- **Security Scanning**: Snyk (v1.1100.0) for identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in the codebase
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub for collaborative code management
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment to Vercel (frontend) and AWS (backend)
## Project Structure

The LegalEase codebase follows a well-organized structure to maintain clarity and scalability as the application grows:

```
legal-ease/
├── frontend/                 # React frontend code
├── backend/                  # Node.js backend code
├── docs/                     # Documentation
├── scripts/                  # Automation scripts
└── infrastructure/           # IaC and deployment configurations
```

> **For the complete file structure details, see [file-structure.md](file-structure.md)**

## Security
- **Data Encryption**: HTTPS for data in transit and AES-256 encryption for data at rest in PostgreSQL and S3
- **Authentication**: JWT-based login with optional 2FA via Auth0/Okta
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to limit data and feature access by user role (e.g., lawyer, staff)
- **Backups**: Daily automated backups via AWS RDS, 7-day retention, point-in-time recovery enabled
- **Compliance**: Designed to meet data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) based on user needs

# Development Workflow
- **Branching Strategy**: GitFlow (feature branches, develop, main)
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory pull request (PR) reviews via GitHub
- **Testing**: Automated tests run on every PR; manual E2E tests before releases
- **Deployment Process**: GitHub Actions automates testing, building, and deployment to staging and production environments
## Known Issues & Limitations

- **Elasticsearch Indexing Latency**: Under high document loads, there may be a 1-2 minute delay in search index updates. This is being addressed through our optimized batch indexing strategy.
- **Third-party Calendar Sync**: Outlook calendar sync may experience occasional delays due to Microsoft API rate limiting.
