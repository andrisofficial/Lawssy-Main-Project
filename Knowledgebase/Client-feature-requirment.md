* **Description:** Ensure the Client module integrates smoothly with other key parts of the Legal SaaS application.
* **Requirements:**
    * **Case Management:** Client data (Name, ID) must be linkable to Case records. Changes in client status might need to reflect or trigger notifications in associated cases. Accessing client details should be possible from the case view.

* **Requirements:**
    * The database schema and queries should be optimized to handle tens or hundreds of thousands of client records without significant performance degradation.
    * The application architecture should support scaling horizontally (adding more servers) if needed to accommodate increased user load.

## 3. Suggestions for Additional Features

Based on common legal practice needs, consider adding these features in future iterations:

1.  **Custom Fields:** Allow firms to define and add their own custom data fields to client profiles to capture unique information relevant to their practice area or workflow. (e.g., "Referral Source", "Industry Type").
2.  **Client Types & Sub-types:** More granular categorization beyond Individual/Organization (e.g., Corporate, Government, Non-Profit, Individual-Plaintiff, Individual-Defendant). This could drive different required fields or workflows.
3.  **Relationship Mapping:** Visually or structurally link related clients or contacts (e.g., spouses in a divorce case, parent company and subsidiary, opposing party). Crucial for conflict checking.
4.  **Conflict Checking Integration:** Directly trigger or integrate with a conflict checking system using the client's name, associated contacts, and potentially related parties.
5.  **Communication Log:** A dedicated area within the client profile to log calls, important emails (maybe via BCC), meetings, and notes related to client communication, distinct from case-specific communication.
6.  **Document Association:** Directly upload or link documents specific to the client entity itself (e.g., retainer agreement, ID verification, intake forms) separate from case documents.
7.  **Tags/Labels:** Flexible, user-defined tags for categorizing clients beyond status or type (e.g., "VIP", "Pro Bono", "Requires Follow-up"). Allows for versatile filtering and grouping.
8.  **Import/Export Functionality:** Allow bulk importing of client data from CSV/Excel and exporting client lists/details in standard formats for reporting or migration.
9.  **Client Portal Integration:** If a client portal exists or is planned, link client records to portal access credentials and activity.
10. **Enhanced Audit Trail Visibility:** Provide a user-friendly interface to view the audit history for a specific client record.
11. **Client Grouping:** Allow grouping clients that are related but managed separately (e.g., multiple cases for the same large corporate client under different subsidiaries).
12. **Geographic Mapping:** Visualize client locations on a map if addresses are stored.

---

## 4. Open Issues / Future Considerations

* Determine the exact list of configurable statuses for Client Status Tracking.
* Finalize the specific fields required for duplicate client checking.
* Define the exact rules for preventing deletion/archiving based on active cases.
* Specify which fields require detailed audit logging beyond basic create/update/delete actions.
* Prioritize the list of suggested additional features for future development phases.

---

## 5. Implementation Plan

To ensure an orderly and systematic development of the Client feature, the implementation has been broken down into 8 phases. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for incremental delivery and validation of the functionality.

### 5.1 Phase 1: Core Client Profile Management

**Status: In Progress**

This phase focuses on establishing the foundation of the Client feature by implementing the basic client profile management capabilities.

   - Set up proper indexes for search performance
   - Establish audit logging structure

2. Implement basic CRUD operations
   - Create new client form with validation (Feature ID: CL-F01)
   - Client detail view component (Feature ID: CL-F03)
   - Client edit functionality (Feature ID: CL-F02)
