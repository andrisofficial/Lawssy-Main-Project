*   Implement API service layers for interacting with the backend.
*   Write unit tests (Jest) and potentially E2E tests (Cypress) for components and flows.
*   Refine styling and ensure responsiveness.

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Backend API delays | High | Medium | Create frontend mocks for parallel development |
| Design system changes | Medium | Low | Implement component abstraction for easy updates |
| Performance issues with large datasets | High | Medium | Implement virtualization and pagination early |
